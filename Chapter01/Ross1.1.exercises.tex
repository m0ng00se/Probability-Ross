For part (c), there are $3!=6$ ways to order 3 boys, and there are $4!=24$ ways to order a set with four elements (the four elements being a group of boys along with three girls). Hence we have $N = 6 \cdot 24 = 144$.

For part (b), persons $A$ and $B$ act as a ``single" person, and there are 2 ways to arrange $A$ and $B$ next to each other. In addition, there are 6 remaining people to seat, which means the total number of ways to arrange the seating is $N = 2 \cdot 7! = 10,080$.

For part (c), if we start the row with a man, there will be $N_1 = (4!)^2 = 576$ ways to arrange the seating. But we could also start the row with a  woman, which means that the total number of arrangements is $N = 2 \cdot 576 = 1,152$.

\[ + \binom{4}{1,3,0}x_1 (2x_2)^3 + \binom{4}{3,1,0}x_1^3 (2x_2) + \binom{4}{1,0,3}x_1(3x_3)^3 \]

\[ + \binom{4}{3,0,1}x_1^3(3x_3) + \binom{4}{0,1,3}(2x_2)(3x_3)^3 + \binom{4}{0,3,1}(2x_2)^3 (3x_3) \]

\[ +\binom{4}{2,2,0}x_1^2(2x_2)^2 + \binom{4}{2,0,2}x_1^2(3x_3)^2 + \binom{4}{0,2,2}(2x_2)^2(3x_3)^2 \]

\[ + \binom{4}{1,1,2}x_1 (2x_2) (3x_3)^2+ \binom{4}{1,2,1}x_1(2x_2)^2(3x_3) + \binom{4}{2,1,1}x_1^2(2x_2)(3x_3) \]

\vspace{2mm}
The values of the coefficients work out to $\binom{4}{4,0,0} = \binom{4}{0,4,0} = \binom{4}{0,0,4} = 1$, and $\binom{4}{1,3,0} = \binom{4}{3,1,0} = \binom{4}{1,0,3} = \binom{4}{3,0,1} = \binom{4}{0,1,3} =  \binom{4}{0,3,1} = 4$, and $\binom{4}{2,2,0} = \binom{4}{2,0,2} = \binom{4}{0,2,2} = 6$, and $\binom{4}{1,1,2} = \binom{4}{1,2,1} = \binom{4}{2,1,1} = 12$ so that:

\[ (x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3)^4 = x_1^4 + 16x_2^4 + 81x_3^4 \]

\[ + 32 x_1 x_2^3 + 8x_1^3x_2 + 108x_1x_3^3 \]

\[ + 12x_1^3x_3 + 216x_2x_3^3 + 96x_2^3x_3\]

\[ + 24x_1^2x_2^2 + 54x_1^2x_3^2 + 216x_2^2 x_3^2 \]

\[ +216 x_1 x_2 x_3^2 + 144x_1 x_2^2 x_3 + 72x_1^2 x_2 x_3 \]

For part (a), the number of divisions is:

\[ N =  \sum_{n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 8} \binom{8}{n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4} \]

We can use the expression:

\[ (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_r)^n = \sum_{n_1 + ... + n_r = n}\binom{n}{n_1, ..., n_r} x_1^{n_1} \cdot \cdot \cdot x_r^{n_r} \]

\noindent
so that 

\[ (1 + 1 + ... + 1)^n = r^n = \sum_{n_1 + ... + n_r = n} \binom{n}{n_1, ..., n_r} \]

\noindent
and

\[ \sum_{n_1+n_2+n_3+n_4 = 8} \binom{8}{n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4} =  4^8 = 65,536 \]

If the scoring takes account of the countries that the lifters represent, but not their individual identities, how many different outcomes are possible from the point of view of scores? How many different outcomes correspond to results in which the United States has 1 competitor in the top three and 2 in the bottom three?
\vspace{2mm}
\end{minipage}
}
}

For part (a), the number of possible outcomes is:

\[ N = \binom{10}{3,4,2,1} = \frac{10!}{3! \cdot 4! \cdot 2! \cdot 1!} = 12,600 \]

\vspace{2mm}
For part (b), there are $N_1 = \binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose the top-ranking American and $N_2 = \binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways to choose the remaining top-ranking contestants, which gives a total of $N_3 = 63$ ways to choose all the top-ranking contestants. 

There are also $N_1' = \binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose the bottom-ranking Americans and $N_2' = \binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to choose the remaining bottom-ranking contestants, which gives a total of $N_3' = 15$ ways to choose all the bottom-ranking contestants. 

The number of ways to choose the remaining 4 contestants in the middle is now fixed. Hence, the total number of possible outcomes is:

\[ N = 63 \cdot 15 \cdot 1 = 945 \]

How many different seating arrangements are possible if the French and English delegates are to be seated next to each other and the Russian and U.S. delegates are not to be next to each other?
\vspace{2mm}
\end{minipage}

}

The total number of seating arrangements, subject to no constraints, is $N_1 = 10! = 3,628,800$.

The total number of seating arrangements, where France and England sit next to each other, is $N_2 = 2 \cdot 9! = 725,760$. The number of seating arrangements, where France and England sit next to each other, and where the U.S. and Russia sit next to each other, is $N_3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! = 161,280$. 

Hence, the number of seating arraignments here France and England sit next to each other, and where the U.S. and Russia do not sit next to each other, is:

\[ N = 2 \cdot 9! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! = 564,480 \]

For part (a), we must solve the equation:

\[ n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 8\]

\noindent 
subject to the constraint that $n_i \ge 0$. 

The result given in the text indicates that there are $\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$ distinct non-negative integer vectors $(x_1,...,x_r)$ satisfying the equation $\sum_{i=1}^r x_i = n$. In our case, we have $n=8$ and $r=4$, hence, the total number of solutions is:

\[ N = \binom{8+4-1}{4-1} = \binom{11}{3} = 165 \]

\vspace{2mm}
For part (b), we must solve the equation:

\[ n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 8\]

subject to the constraint that $n_i > 0$.

The result given in the text indicates that there are $\binom{n-1}{r-1}$ distinct positive integer vectors $(x_1,...,x_r)$ satisfying the equation $\sum_{i=1}^r x_i = n$. In our case, we have $n=8$ and $r=4$, hence, the total number of solutions is:

In how many ways could the operator have perceived the people leaving the elevator if all people look alike to him? What if the 8 people consisted of 5 men and 3 women and the operator could tell a man from a woman?
\vspace{2mm}
\end{minipage}
}
}

For part (a), if we indicate with $n_i$ the number of people who exit on the $i$-th floor, we can arrive at the answer by calculating how many non-negative integer solutions there are for the following equation:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^6 x_i = 8 \]

From the result in the text, there are $\binom{n+r-1}{r-1}$ distinct non-negative integer vectors $(x_1, ..., x_r)$ satisfying the equation $\sum_{x=1}^r x_i = n$. In our case, we have $n=8$ and $r=6$, so the total number of solutions is:

\[ N = \binom{8+6-1}{6-1} = \binom{13}{5} = 1,287 \]

For part (b), we must track the men and women separately. We indicate with $m_i$ the number of men who exit on the $i$-th floor, and we indicate by $w_i$ the number of women who exit on the $i$-th floor. 

A total of 5 men must exit somewhere on the 6 floors:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^6 m_i = 5 \]

\noindent
and a total of 3 women must exit somewhere on the 6 floors:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^6 w_i = 3 \]

There are $N_1 = \binom{6+5-1}{6-1} = \binom{10}{5} = 252$ non-negative integer solutions to the first equation, and $N_2 = \binom{6+3+1}{6-1} = \binom{8}{5} = 56$ non-negative integer solutions to the second equation. 

Any one of the combinations $(m_1,...,m_6)$ by which the men can leave the elevator can be combined with any one of the combinations $(w_1, ..., w_6)$ by which the women can leave the elevator. Hence, the total number of ways to leave the elevator that the operator can discern is:

\[ N = 252 \cdot 126 = 14,112 \]

33. We have 20,000 dollars that must be invested among 4 possible opportunities. Each investment must be integral in units of 1,000 dollars, and there are minimal investments that need to be made if one is to invest in these opportunities. The minimal investments are 2, 2, 3 and 4 thousand dollars. How many different investment strategies are available if:

(a) an investment is to be made in each opportunity?

(b) investments must be made in at least 3 of the four opportunities?
\vspace{2mm}
\end{minipage}
}
}

For part (a), if we invest in all 4 vehicles, we must put side $T = 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11$ thousand dollars before any other decisions are made. That leaves 9 thousand dollars to invest amongst 4 different vehicles. We must therefore solve the equation:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^4 x_i = 9\]

\noindent
subject to the constraint that $x_i \ge 0$. From the result in the text, there are $N = \binom{4+9-1}{4-1} = \binom{12}{3} = 220$ ways to do this. 

For part (b), there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose 3 of the 4 investment vehicles, and there is $\binom{4}{4} = 1$ ways to choose all 4 investment vehicles. 

Indicate by $V_i$ the $i$-th investment vehicle. If we choose to invest in all four investment vehicles, we have, by the previous result, $N_1 = 220$ ways to accomplish this. 

If we choose to invest only in vehicles $V_1, V_2$ and $V_3$, we must set aside $2+2+3 = 7$ thousand dollars, which leaves an additional 13 thousand dollars to be distributed amongst 3 investment vehicles: 

\[ \sum_{i=1}^3 x_i = 13 \]

\noindent
This can be done in $N_2 = \binom{3+13-1}{3-1} = \binom{15}{2} = 105$ ways. 

If we choose to invest only in vehicles $V_1, V_2$ and $V_4$, we must set aside $2+2+4 = 8$ thousand dollars, which leaves an additional 12 thousand dollars to be distributed amongst 3 investment vehicles:

\[ \sum_{x=1}^3 x_i = 12 \]

\noindent
This can be done in $N_3 = \binom{3+12-1}{3-1} = \binom{14}{2} = 91$ ways. 

If we choose to invest only in vehicles $V_1, V_3$ and $V_4$, we must set aside $2+3+4 = 9$ thousand dollars, which leaves an additional 11 thousand dollars to be distributed amongst 3 investment vehicles:

\[ \sum_{x=1}^3 x_i = 11 \]

\noindent
This can be done in $N_4 = \binom{3+11-1}{3-1} = \binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways.

If we choose to invest only in vehicles $V_2, V_3$ and $V_4$, we must set aside $2+3+4 = 9$ thousand dollars, which leaves an additional 11 thousand dollars to be distributed amongst 3 investment vehicles:

\[ \sum_{x=1}^3 x_i = 11 \]

\noindent
This can be done in $N_5 = \binom{3+11-1}{3-1} = \binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways. 

The total number of ways to make investments in at least 3 of the 4 vehicles is therefore:

\[ N = 220 + 105 + 91 + 78 + 78 = 572 \]
